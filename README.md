# IK Character Manager

This is a character manager for the [Iron Kingdoms roleplaying game][1] which I'm
writing as an exercise in getting a better handle on [Ember][2] and as an
oportunity to play around with some of the newer features supported by browsers
such as the [Flexible Box Layout Module][3] and technologies I haven't had much
change to play with such as [SVG][4].
